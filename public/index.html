<h1 id="welcome-to-my-page">Welcome to My Page</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a student with a passion for coding in my free time and tinkering with low-level languages. This is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and projects.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not in class, you&rsquo;ll find me exploring systems programming, diving into assembly code, and understanding how computers work at a deeper level. I love the challenge of working with languages like C, Rust, and Assembly—there&rsquo;s something satisfying about writing code that&rsquo;s close to the metal.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s building small tools, contributing to open source, or just experimenting with new ideas, I&rsquo;m always learning and pushing my boundaries as a developer.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-love">What I Love</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software. My interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systems Programming</strong>: Building efficient, low-level software that interacts with the operating system and hardware</li>
<li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: Working with microcontrollers and embedded platforms to solve real-world problems</li>
<li><strong>Compiler Design</strong>: Understanding how high-level code is transformed into machine instructions</li>
<li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Writing code that not only works, but works efficiently</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Contributing to and learning from the community</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-approach">My Approach</h2>
<p>I believe in learning by doing. Rather than just reading about concepts, I prefer to implement them myself. This hands-on approach has taught me more than any textbook could. I&rsquo;m always looking for challenging problems to solve and new technologies to explore.</p>
<h2 id="on-this-site">On This Site</h2>
<p>This site is divided into a few main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/posts/">Posts</a></strong>: Deep dives into topics I&rsquo;m learning about, project write-ups, and technical tutorials</li>
<li><strong><a href="/projects/">Projects</a></strong>: A showcase of the things I&rsquo;ve built and am currently working on</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-connect">Let&rsquo;s Connect</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m always happy to chat about coding, systems programming, or anything tech-related. Feel free to reach out through one of my projects on <a href="https://sr.ht/~yzuaf/">SourceHut</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something interesting here!</p>
