# Welcome to My Page

I'm a student with a passion for coding in my free time and tinkering with low-level languages. This is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and projects.

## About Me

When I'm not in class, you'll find me exploring systems programming, diving into assembly code, and understanding how computers work at a deeper level. I love the challenge of working with languages like C, Rust, and Assembly—there's something satisfying about writing code that's close to the metal.

Whether it's building small tools, contributing to open source, or just experimenting with new ideas, I'm always learning and pushing my boundaries as a developer.

## What I Love

I'm fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software. My interests include:

- **Systems Programming**: Building efficient, low-level software that interacts with the operating system and hardware
- **Embedded Systems**: Working with microcontrollers and embedded platforms to solve real-world problems
- **Compiler Design**: Understanding how high-level code is transformed into machine instructions
- **Performance Optimization**: Writing code that not only works, but works efficiently
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and learning from the community

## My Approach

I believe in learning by doing. Rather than just reading about concepts, I prefer to implement them myself. This hands-on approach has taught me more than any textbook could. I'm always looking for challenging problems to solve and new technologies to explore.

## On This Site

This site is divided into a few main sections:

- **[Posts](/posts/)**: Deep dives into topics I'm learning about, project write-ups, and technical tutorials
- **[Projects](/projects/)**: A showcase of the things I've built and am currently working on

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to chat about coding, systems programming, or anything tech-related. Feel free to reach out through one of my projects on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~yzuaf/).
